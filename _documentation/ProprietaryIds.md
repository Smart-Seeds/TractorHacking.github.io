title: Proprietary CAN IDs
---

Among the list of can IDs that are specified by the SAE J1939 format, there are some limited
IDs that are reserved for the manufacturer's use, and are marked as 'proprietary' in the SAE
documentation. These IDs are more difficult to work with, because it is not as clear what their
purpose is, but could prove to be very useful beause they perform manufacturer specific tasks.
