John Deere has overly strict security on the electrical components of its tractor which doesn't allow the owner of a tractor to make simple repairs or upgrades without having a John Deere technician travel out and do it for them. More information about this issue can be [found in this wired article](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/).

Our team has been tasked with decoding the CAN bus messages passed between tractor components, with this knowledge future work on modifying the tractor's electronic systems will be significantly easier.
